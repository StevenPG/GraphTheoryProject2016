# GraphTheoryProject2016
The course project for MAT369 at Kutztown University.

# The main goals of the course project are to:   
- allow students to choose a topic of personal interest for in-depth study and research 
- provide experience in reading technical literature 
- provide experience in self-directing a partnered project 
- provide practice at presenting technical information (orally/visually) at a level approaching that of professional journals/conferences 
- provide a meaningful culminating experience for every student   

# A successful project will:  
- build upon your graph theory foundation (for example, by going deeper into a graph theory topic already covered in this course, by investigating a new area of graph theory that builds upon knowledge gained in the course, or by improving key skills developed in - or relevant to - this course) 
- involve something hard/rigorous 
- involve something creative/original 

# Final Deliverables  
## Your final deliverables will include an oral presentation and a paper.  
## Oral Presentation:    
- Each team will deliver a 15 to 20 minute (depending on team size) presentation on their project. [Number of minutes subject to change once the number of teams is finalized this year.]  
- Successful oral presentations generally omit certain technical details in favor of providing an overview of new material to your peers in a way that is digestible; the technical details can be explained in your supplemental documentation.  
- You will have had a lot of practice in your topic by the end of the semester, but most of your peers will be seeing the material for the first time. It is generally helpful to include many examples. 
- Structure your presentation as you would hope others would structure theirs!  Make it interesting and easy to understand! It should have an easy-to-follow structure (introduction through conclusions).  
- Through your oral presentation, it should be obvious how the topic builds upon your graph theory foundation, what was hard/rigorous, and what was creative. 
- You may include brief interactive activities with the class, but be mindful of time because these activities often take longer than anticipated.   
- Give credit where credit is due (for figures, graphs, theorems, algorithms, etc.)   

## Scientific Paper  
- Every project will include an annotated bibliography.  Include full bibliographic information for each reference, along with a quick indication of how the reference was used.   
- The length of the paper is not required, but suggested to be between 5 to 10 pages. It will include an introduction, main part, and the conclusion. 
- The paper will also include some of the following:  
- Detailed proofs that you wrote 
- Detailed descriptions of algorithms that you wrote (or very well commented code) 
- The details of certain examples, or more advanced examples 
- Any other work that was critical to the overall project
