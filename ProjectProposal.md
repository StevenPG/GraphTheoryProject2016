# Project Proposal

1. Topic - Investigate the efficiency of the A* algorithm over Dijkstra's Algorithm. Create a web application that applies these two algorithms to the Kutztown Campus that is functional and can display the differences between the two algorithms.
2. I will look into Dijkstra's original paper and the later published A* paper, along with resources that reference and discuss these things.
3. Project Outline Components
  1. Pathfinding algorithms are used through all different types of software. The A* algorithm is used more commonly in video games than Dijkstra's, while Dijkstra's is heralded as the more popular shortest path algorithm. 
  2. Gain a complete understanding of the effectiveness of Dijkstra's vs A* algorithm. Develop a functional web application that allows a user to select to use either Dijkstra's or the A* algorithm and find the shortest path between two locations on the Kutztown Campus.
  3. The topic is appropriate because it would allow me to combine graph theory and computer science (my major) to create a software application that is both useful, and allows a visualization of the two shortest path methods.
  4. The project will allow me to delve deeper and understand the functinality and the intracacies and issues of the shortest path problem. This will give me insight into problems like the traveling salesman problem and the chinese postman problem.
  5. The project is hard a rigorous in that on top of learning and understanding the algorithms, and writing an academic paper regarding them, I will also have to implement a piece of software that works and implements these algorithms effectively.\
  6. I have never seen anything like this before that applies the algorithms to a real life environment on a small scale. The option to use different algorithms with different visualizations will also be a unique way for someone at Kutztown to select two locations, and see how the Algorithms will differ.
