# Possible Ideas for a project
1. Pathfinding Algorithm like A-star
  1. Possibly research and write a project in p5 to generate the shortest path between two points on campus.++
  2. Possibly do research and look into the different types of pathfinding and how they differ from Dijkstra's Algorithm.
  3. Reference usage in games?
2. Look into how planar graphs are used to build computer CPUS
  1. Research how they are used to determine whether a circuit can be implemented on a planar circuit board or not.
3. Look into how the graph coloring thereom is used in computer science.
  1. Used for Radio/TV/Phone radio frequencies
  2. Register allocation for software variables
